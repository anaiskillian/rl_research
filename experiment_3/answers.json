      "model_response": "Step 1: First, let's determine how much money Betty currently has. Since she has half of the money she needs, we can calculate this by dividing the total cost of the wallet by 2.\nBetty's current money = $100 / 2 = $50\n\nStep 2: Next, let's calculate how much money Betty's parents gave her. They gave her $15, so we can add this to her current money to find out how much she has after receiving the money from her parents.\nBetty's money after parents = $50 + $15 = $65\n\nStep 3: Now, let's calculate how much money Betty's grandparents gave her. They gave her twice as much as her parents, so we can multiply the amount given by her parents by 2.\nBetty's money after grandparents = $65 * 2 = $130\n\nStep 4: Finally, let's calculate how much more money Betty needs to buy the wallet. We can subtract the amount she has from the total cost of the wallet.\nAmount needed = $100 - $65 = $35\n\nTherefore, Betty needs $35 more to buy the wallet.\n\\boxed{35}",

      "model_response": "Step 1: First, let's find out how many purple flowers Mark has. We know that there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers. To find the number of purple flowers, we can calculate 80% of 10 yellow flowers and add it to the number of yellow flowers.\nPurple flowers = 10 yellow flowers + (80% of 10 yellow flowers)\nPurple flowers = 10 yellow flowers + (0.80 * 10 yellow flowers)\nPurple flowers = 10 yellow flowers + 8 yellow flowers\nPurple flowers = 18 yellow flowers\n\nStep 2: Now that we know there are 18 yellow flowers, we can find out how many green flowers there are. We know that there are 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. To find the number of green flowers, we can calculate 25% of the sum of yellow and purple flowers.\nGreen flowers = (25% of (10 yellow flowers + 18 yellow flowers))\nGreen flowers = (0.25 * (10 yellow flowers + 18 yellow flowers))\nGreen flowers = (0.25 * 28 yellow flowers)\nGreen flowers = 7 yellow flowers\n\nStep 3: Now that we know there are 7 yellow flowers, we can find out the total number of flowers in Mark's garden by adding the number of yellow, purple, and green flowers.\nTotal flowers = (Number of yellow flowers + Number of purple flowers + Number of green flowers)\nTotal flowers = (10 yellow flowers + 18 yellow flowers + 7 yellow flowers)\nTotal flowers = 35 yellow flowers + 18 yellow flowers\nTotal flowers = 53 yellow flowers + 18 yellow flowers\nTotal flowers = 71 yellow flowers\n\nTherefore, Mark has 71 yellow, 18 purple, and 7 green flowers in his garden.\nAnswer: 71\n\\boxed{71}",
