        "model_response": "Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Betty currently has.\nBetty needs $100 for the wallet and has only half of the money she needs, so she currently has $100 / 2 = $50.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the amount of money Betty's grandparents give her.\nBetty's grandparents give her twice as much as her parents, who gave her $15. So, her grandparents give her $15 * 2 = $30.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total amount of money Betty has after receiving money from her parents and grandparents.\nBetty initially has $50, and after receiving $15 from her parents and $30 from her grandparents, she has $50 + $15 + $30 = $95.\n\nStep 4: Calculate how much more money Betty needs to buy the wallet.\nThe wallet costs $100, and Betty has $95, so she needs $100 - $95 = $5 more.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Betty still needs to buy the wallet is \\boxed{5",
