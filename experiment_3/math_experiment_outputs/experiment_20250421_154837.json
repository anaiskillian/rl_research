She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
        "model_response": "Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs Janet has left after eating and baking. She starts with 16 eggs per day, eats 3 for breakfast, and bakes 4 eggs. So, the number of eggs left is 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs.\nStep 2: Calculate the amount of money Janet makes from selling the remaining eggs. She sells the remaining eggs at $2 per egg. So, the amount of money she makes is 9 * $2 = $18.\nAnswer:\n\\boxed{18",

        "model_response": "Step 1: First, let's calculate the amount of white fiber needed. Since the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, we can calculate the amount of white fiber as 2/2 = 1 bolt.\nStep 2: Now, let's calculate the total amount of fiber needed. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber, so the total amount of fiber needed is 2 + 1 = 3 bolts.\nAnswer:\n\\boxed{3",

        "model_response": "Step 1: First, let's calculate the total cost of the house and the repairs. The total cost is the sum of the house price and the repairs, which is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\nStep 2: Next, we need to calculate the increase in the value of the house due to the repairs. The increase is 150% of the original value of the house, which is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000.\nStep 3: Now, let's calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The new value is the original value plus the increase, which is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.\nStep 4: Finally, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house. The profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.\nAnswer:\n\\boxed{70000",

He runs 3 sprints a week, so the total distance for one sprint is 60 meters * 3 sprints = 180 meters.\nStep 3: Calculate the total distance James runs in one week. He runs 180 meters for one sprint, and he runs 3 sprints a week, so the total distance for one week is 180 meters * 3 sprints = 540 meters.\nAnswer:\n\\boxed{540",

She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?",
        "model_response": "Step 1:  First, we need to understand the total amount of feed Wendi gives to her chickens each day. She feeds each chicken three cups of feed, and she has a flock of 20 chickens. So, the total amount of feed she gives in a day is 3 cups per chicken * 20 chickens = 60 cups.\nStep 2:  We are given that Wendi gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives 15 cups, and in the afternoon, she gives another 25 cups. So, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups.\nStep 3:  To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed given in a day. This gives us 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups.\nStep 4:  Therefore, Wendi needs to give 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.\nAnswer:\n\\boxed{20",
