To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of the original value of the house, which is $80,000. So, the increase in value is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000.\n\nAdding this increase to the original value gives the new value of the house: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.\n\nTo find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value of the house: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.\n\nSo, Josh made a profit of $70,000. \\boxed{70000",
