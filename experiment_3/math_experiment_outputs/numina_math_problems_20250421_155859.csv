Problem 4. A $5 \times 100$ table is divided into 500 unit square cells, where $n$ of them are coloured black and the rest are coloured white. Two unit square cells are called adjacent if they share a common side. Each of the unit square cells has at most two adjacent black unit square cells. Find the largest possible value of $n$.

Problem 3. Find all the triples of integers $(a, b, c)$ such that the number

$$
N=\frac{(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)}{2}+2
$$

is a power of 2016 .

(A power of 2016 is an integer of the form $2016^{n}$, where $n$ is a non-negative integer.)
